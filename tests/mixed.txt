This is a test of mixed text and XHTML. It has
empty lines to denote paragraphs (this is the first)
but there are embedded XHTML tags.

This is the second para, which ends with 𐄁<b>bold</b>𐄁.

This is the third, with 𐄁<b>bold</b>𐄁 and 𐄁<i>italic</i>.𐄁

This para has special characters &, <, and >, which should appear
as they are, and not be treated as having any special XHTML sense.
